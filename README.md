# Week-1
# **CNN model for Waste Mangement**

## Project Description
This project aims to design and train a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between organic and recyclable waste images. The model can be integrated into waste management systems to automate the sorting process, reducing contamination rates and increasing recycling efficiency.

## Featuers
 - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
 - Image Preprocessing and Data Augmentation
 - Training and Validation on a dataset of organic and recyclable images
 - Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
